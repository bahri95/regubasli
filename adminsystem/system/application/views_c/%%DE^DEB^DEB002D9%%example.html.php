        <h3>History of The Department</h3>
        <p>The history of Neurosurgical services in Surabaya can not be separated from the History of Indonesia Neurosurgical Services. The first Indonesian neurosurgeon is S.K. Handoyo,MD who had just come from neurosurgical training in Holland, in 1953. At that time he gave services only in Jakarta. In 1958, Indonesia get 2 more neurosurgeons who also trained in Holland. They are : Soewadji Prawirohardjo,MD and Basoeki Wirjowidjojo,MD.</p>
        <p>Concerning the request from Airlangga University School of Medicine, Dr. Basoeki Wirjowidjojo moved to Surabaya and gave neurosurgical services until nowadays. In 1975, Surabaya neurosurgical services got additional neurosurgeon : H.M. Sajid Darmadipura,MD and followed by Umar Kasan,MD. And in 1983, Abdul Hafid Bajamal,MD had come from neurosurgical training too. All of them had finished their medical doctor in Airlangga University and trained as neurosurgeon in Nijmegen. At that time, the neurosurgical service was still part of Department of Surgery. But as time ticking on, the amount of cases is increasing year by year. It demands more developed department to take care. By those reason, the Department of Neurosurgery was founded. Nowadays, we have 8 medical staff and about 25 medical doctors following residency program.</p>
